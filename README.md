# Profile-Generator (homework 10)
Node.js cli that takes in information about employees, then generates an HTML webpage to display summaries of each person..
## Description

This project I hit a wall. I can not figure out how to get it working and have run out of time. Didn't even get the chance to do tests. I'm feeling a bit disapointed, as this was week covered topics I really wanted to get a grasp of, and failed misserablly. How do we circle back on these things we only skimmed the surface of?
